# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Course project: This project was to take data from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" and combine the test and training data sets. The data was then filtered to only have the mean and standard deviation of each variable. Finally the data was grouped by subject & activity and the mean of each variable was generated.

The analysis

The following description of the raw data was taken from the Dataset readme file.

For each record it is provided:

-   Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.

-   Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

-   A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

-   Its activity label.

-   An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. The dataset includes the following files: =========================================

-   'README.txt'

-   'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

-   'features.txt': List of all features.

-   'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

-   'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

-   'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

-   'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

-   'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
